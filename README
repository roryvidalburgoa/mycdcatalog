DESCRIPTION
===========

MyCDCatalog is a simple KDE2 application.

MyCDCatalog reads a CDROM volume (ISO9660) takes its information, traverses
the file system tree and stores information about each file and directory
found. CDROM, file and directory information are stored in a MySQL database
for future use.

MyCDCatalog shows the options, in order to mount the CDROM, read
it recursively, and connect to a MySQL server. Then it required the mysql connection data.

MyCDCatalog is able to use file handlers, because it identifies file types using the
UNIX tool "file". Currently only MP3 files have their handler to retreive information.

REQUIREMENTS
============

Of course you need to have access to the MySQL server.
	At least:
	- MySQL v3.23
	- mysql++ v1.7.9
	- KDE v2.1.2
	- qt v2.3

MP3 Handler, needs:
	At Least:
	- ID3Lib v3.7.13


INSTALLATION
============

See INSTALL file for general installation.

This application needs to have a database in the server with some tables
created, this is done by using the file "mycdcatalog.sql". The procedure for
create the DB tables is:

   Using the mysql client (or other):
      %> CREATE DATABASE aDatabase;

      %> mysql -u aUsername -p aDataBase < mycdcatalog.sql
         aDataBase need to exists before executing this command.

After creating the DB and their tables, just use MyCDCatalog: fill the initial
form of options. Then an other widget will appear showing you the progress of
reading process with info about the CDROM, when that process has finished a
table with final results will be showed.

The file "mycdcatalog.sql" describes the kind of information to store for a
CDROM, a file and a directory.

An example of a Volume (a CDROM) row into DB:
+----+--------+--------+--------+----------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+-------------+--------------+--------+----------+
| id | vol_id | sys_id | pub_id | preparer | app_id   | size      | nbdirs | nbfiles | unread_dirs | unread_files | status | complete |
+----+--------+--------+--------+----------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+-------------+--------------+--------+----------+
|  3 | APPS   | LINUX  | ME     | YOU		   | CDRECORD | 712980480 |     14 |     184 |           0 |            0 |      1 |        1 |
+----+--------+--------+--------+----------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+-------------+--------------+--------+----------+

A Dir Row:
+----+---------+-------------+-------------+-------------+--------+-------+
| id | path    | date_lmodif | date_access | nb_dirfiles | father | cdrom |
+----+---------+-------------+-------------+-------------+--------+-------+
| 39 | ./RPMS  |         116 |         115 |         475 |     38 |     3 |
+----+---------+-------------+-------------+-------------+--------+-------+

A File row:
+------+---------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| id   | name                      | date_lmodif | date_access | size    | type | ext | dirpath | cdrom |
+------+---------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| 1420 | kdevelop-1.4.1-2.i386.rpm |        1221 |        1222 | 3304452 |    8 |  11 |      39 |     3 |
+------+---------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+

A DateTime row:
+------+---------------------+
| id   | dt                  |
+------+---------------------+
| 1221 | 2001-04-08 21:34:01 |
+------+---------------------+

A Type row:
+----+----------+-------------+
| id | code     | description |
+----+----------+-------------+
|  8 | ffffeedb | RPM         |
+----+----------+-------------+

An Extension row:
+----+------+
| id | name |
+----+------+
| 11 | rpm  |
+----+------+

Because there are many system call like mount, umount, etc. that only a root
user can use, this software will work only with "root".
I designed this only for my needs, but after a while I decided to share it,
hoping to be useful, I don't designed it to be a multiplataform application,
I work with a LINUX system and use features of that kernel when accessing
the cdrom drive.

The MP3 Handler uses new tables for MP3 information, the file mp3handler.sql
has the definition of that tables. ID3v1 and ID3v2 are stored, also MPEG information
to know duration in time of MP3 files and other useful information.

REFERENCES AND THANKS
=====================

Well, in order to read a CDROM information (i.e. ISO9660 Volume information)
I used some source code from the "cdrtools-1.10" source distribution 
(Author: Jörg Schilling).
	http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html

For connecting to a MySQL server and make SQL requests I used the C++ API
library "mysql++-1.7.9"
(Author: kevinatk@home.com).
	http://www.mysql.com/downloads/index.html

The MP3 handler use library ID3 v3.7.13 for retreive ID3 tags V1 and V2:
	http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=979 or
	http://id3lib.sourceforge.net

For retreive data from the MPEG headers I modified code from EasyTag v0.15
	http://easytag.sourceforge.net

For detecting the file type I modified the source distribution
of "file-3.37-5" (Author: Ian F. Darwin) that use magic files.

Because I haven't yet a good documentation I add here the "file-3.37-5"
