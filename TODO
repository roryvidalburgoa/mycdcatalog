How to know if it's a MultiSession CD ?
Read and mount all sessions in a CD. Only last session for now.
When reading a CDROM info, the first session is read, it needs to be
the last one.

Make a nice interface for searching into the created Database, I've think
in PHP for make this interface. By now you can use "phpMyAdmin"
(http://www.phpwizard.net/projects/phpMyAdmin/) for see your row tables.

When finding an incomplete CDROM, resuming the reading, by now it only deletes
the incomplete information about a CDROM.

Give the possibility to change the Volume ID if it exists into DB and the volume
is a new volume.

Create the DB if it doesn't exists yet.

Some options like the MAGIC file to use.

A true plugin system using *.so files for dynamic loading.

Add new File Handlers, for files like PDF or AVI , etc. These file handlers
may take info about that file types.

And many other things to do yet!!!
